# Robot-Sensor-Program
- This project was made for the year 1 capstone project in university a few years back.
- Salvaged the version that did not have the two additional modes that went beyond the scope of the curriculum.
- This version contains Curious and Scaredy modes.
Needs a finch robot to work and the finch libary. Java Swing was used for the GUI.
